Legend has it that during the rule of Palegondulu in Tirupati and its surrounding areas, there was rampant harassment of women. In the village of Avilala, Goddess Gangamma was born and grew into a beautiful woman. When Palegondulu attempted to harm her, she used her divine grace and power to threaten him, causing him to hide in a remote location.To draw Palegondulu out of hiding, Gangamma devised the 'Ganga Jathara', a festival where people in Tirupati dressed in peculiar costumes and performed rituals for seven days. On the seventh day, Palegondulu emerged from hiding and was defeated by Goddess Gangamma, ensuring the welfare and safety of all people.","Ganga Jatara, the folk festival of Tirupati, commences with the formal Chatimpu (announcement) around midnight on Tuesday. Organized by the Theallaya Mirasi Achari family, specifically Eepur Achari and Kasi Achari, they oversee all arrangements for the festival.This festival, held annually in May, holds great significance for the people of Tirupati and is centered around the Tataiahgunta Gangamma Temple, located on the banks of Thathaya gunta.The rituals begin with priests performing initiatory ceremonies and tying 'Vadibalu' to the 'Viswaroopa Sthambam' in front of the temple, marking the start of the festivities. Men carrying dappus roam through the old town announcing the festival's commencement, urging residents not to leave town until its conclusion.A highlight of the festival is the creation of a traditional large clay idol of the goddess at the temple's entrance. Throughout the festival, devotees flock to pray and offer pongal, sarees, turmeric, kumkum, and other items to the goddess.On the final day, the clay idol on the portico is ceremoniously smashed into pieces at an auspicious moment.
